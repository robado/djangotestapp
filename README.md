# My djangotestapp

This repository is for my Django test app. This is only a practise on how to make a Django app. I will try to make a 
blog but after that I will try to modify it as I like it.

I don't know that will I explain somewhere that what I have done because this is mostly for me and after some time it
 wold be filled with just comments and wouldn't look any good. Maybe I will write in the commit messages.

What I want my Django App to do?
---
With this testing and practising I want to try to make it to do the stuff I want my projects Django App to do. So 
what I have though on what my app should be able to do are the following:

* Create user
* Log in (with existing user)
* User can choose an API source
* When API source is chosen it will open in a new view
* (In API source view) Button to authorize the source
* (In API source view) Button to show (maybe Power BI) report of the API data
* Button to return to the main menu
* User can de-authorize the API source
* (Probably) can delete the report view
    * This will probably be done with the de-authorization the API source

**Admin**
* Can view all the backend
* Can see other users API data
